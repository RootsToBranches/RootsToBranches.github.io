	</figure>
	<p>Like many Chinese men from the Toishan region of Guangdong, my great grandfather Joseph had immigrated to Canada as early as 1888 to pursue the promise of work and wealth.  He was employed by the Canadian Pacific Railway company and worked as both a logger and a farmer for a time in Victoria, BC. In December of 1927, he died due to pneumonia, leaving behind his wife, Soon Yee Lee, and their 7 surviving children.</p>

	<p>My great grandmother Soon Yee Mah was brought to Canada in 1905 by an aunt who had been living and working in British Columbia. Soon Yee was educated at a mission school in Victoria, BC, and soon married Joseph in 1908 at the age of 20. They lived in Vancouver for a short time before moving to Sidney with their 8 children. In 1927, shortly after the death of their infant son, her husband Joseph died of pneumonia. In 1930 Soon Yee moved with 5 of her 7 surviving children to Parkland, AB, where she ran a restaurant for over a year before moving to Calgary. Soon Yee Lee died in 1991 at the age of 103 and was buried in the Calgary Chinese Cemetery with her husband and their son, who had been moved from Sidney.</p>

	<p>My grandfather, Jung Mung Tow, migrated to Canada in 1908 and had worked as a house servant and a farmer before returning to China to participate in the 1911 Chinese Revolution. During this time, he was married to his first wife and had two sons. Upon returning to Canada, he, along with 4 others, established the Hing Wah Market Garden that stood on Macleod Trail. Unable to return to China, he married his second wife, my grandmother, Anna in 1935.</p>

	<p>Anna and Mung Tow had 5 sons, one of whom died in infancy, as well as 2 daughters. They lived in a house in Tuxedo that still stands today. When my mother was 16 she moved to Salt Lake City to live with her eldest brother. When she returned to Calgary after completing high school, her brother, Gerald, set her up on a date with his friend, Tom, my father.</p>

	<p>We don’t know a lot about my paternal great grandparents. We know that my great grandfather had been working in British Columbia in the early 1900s, possibly as early as the late 1800s. At some point he returned to China and married Thoo Hu Shee, whom he brought back to Canada somewhere between 1922-1923. The circumstances of my great grandmother’s immigration are somewhat dubious, as the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923 effectively restricted any Chinese from immigrating into the country, and before this, the Chinese Head Tax made immigration prohibitively expensive for most. It’s something of an unverifiable family legend that my grandmother was born on the boat crossing over.</p>

	</figure>
	<p>Not long after arriving in Victoria, Chow-Kam moved his family to Calgary in search of work. Being Chinese, the family struggled to make ends meet in a society that deeply and bitterly resented their presence. My grandmother would often recount to us stories about Chinese men and women being beaten (or worse) for being found outside of Chinatown after dusk. My grandmother didn’t encourage her children to speak Toishanese – she “didn’t want them to stand out any more than they already did.”</p>

	<p>When my grandmother was around 16, she was married (read given) to a businessman from Cardston. However, after a short time, she ran away and rejoined her family in Calgary, refusing to go back. In Calgary, she met my paternal grandfather Jack Ko, whom she married and had three sons and a daughter. However, like many Chinese men, Jack had a first wife and family in China, to whom he still felt obligated. When he was able, he sent for his first family to cross over to Canada. Typically, when a situation like this occurred, the first wife would assume a hierarchical role above the second wife in the family and the children of the second wife would become those of the first. Finding this arrangement to be unacceptable, Mary left Jack and raised her four kids as a single mother, eventually finding work with an insurance company.</p>

	<p>My dad grew up in Chinatown in a house that used to stand across the street from Eau Claire Market – what was then a bus depot. When my grandmother left my grandfather, my dad became the ‘man of the house’ at the age of 9, having to fix and maintain things around the home, as well as look for any means of income. Although this forced him to grow up faster than he would have otherwise, he still managed to enjoy his childhood and youth. Before finding his career in mental health, he also worked as a busboy, a teacher, an electrician, and a framer (to name only a few).</p>

	<p>My parents received their respective Bachelor of Education at the University of Calgary. After graduating, they lived and worked on the Morley and Goodfish reserves for several years with their beagle, Beau (pictured with my mother). They often speak of this time in their lives with a special fondness and nostalgia. After this, my father went on to receive his Master’s in social work, working at the Foothills Hospital in mental health; my mother continued her career as a CBE educator for nearly four decades.</p>

	<p>Having grown up in a stable, middle-class suburban home far removed from old Chinatown, it can be difficult to relate to the strife and turmoil my ancestors faced so that their families could flourish in a land of peace and plenty. My father was (and still is) always sure to caution us: “be careful what you do and who you do it in front of – you don’t look like the others”. When we were kids, we didn’t understand that we are perhaps the first generation in our family to have not experienced systemic racism on a societal level; for our parents and their parents, and their parents, this had been a reality of everyday life. Yet, though unseen, the foundations of the roots remain true to the branch.</p>
