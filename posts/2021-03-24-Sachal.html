		<p>My family and I immigrated to Canada from Pakistan in September 2008 just a couple days before my 15th birthday. The transition of moving to a foreign country and leaving everything behind was not as jarring for me and my sister as it was for my parents. They were both in their 50’s and were experts in their respective fields. Both of my parents were university professors. My dad taught geology while my mom was a professor of home economics. Sacrifice is at the heart of every immigrant’s story. No one chooses to abandon their homeland, their family, their friends, careers, and everything else just for the fun of it. Parents make those sacrifices and those hard decisions not for themselves but for their children. My parents made those sacrifices in order to guarantee that my sister and I had the best of opportunities and a chance at even a better life. More so than could be achieved in our homeland.</p>  
 
<p>For me the culture shock of moving to Canada wasn’t so shocking because of all the things I had grown up watching from cartoons, movies, and television were now fully realized in front of me. I had never seen snow before coming to Calgary. We made a whole lot of snowmen that first year. I recall pointing out a Subway restaurant on the drive from the airport. My way of finally realizing yes, we’re in a new country and that Subway restaurants are real and don’t just exist only on a television screen.</p>
