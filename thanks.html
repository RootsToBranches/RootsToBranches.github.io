      <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

      <p>First, weâ€™d like to thank each and every one of our contributors and visitors- without your stories and passion, this project would be nothing.</p>

		<p>A very special thank you to Patrick Sullivan, Faye Salins, and Zuzana Ritzer at the SAIT International Centre for broadcasting our project to the community.</p>  

		<p>A ginormous thank you to Christine Hayes at Calgary Public Library for spotlighting numerous opportunities offered by the library, and allowing us to showcase them.</p>

		<p>And of course, a big thank you to our instructor, Donna Campbell- for connecting us to the right people and the right information, and in that: embodying the ideal and the spirit of librarianship.</p>
